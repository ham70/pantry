Pantry tracking app built with Next.js, mui, emotion, and firebase.

Items can be added to pantry database manually including a quantity attribue.

Items are displayed in two ways: a list of all avaible items and a search feature dynamically displaying items whose name match the text in the search bar.

Items can have their quantities updated from where they are displayed as well as be deleted. If a item's quantity is updated to 0 it will automatically be deleted.
